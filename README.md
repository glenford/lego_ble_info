This is an experiment to get LEGO Bluetooth device data using Rust.

It may or may not evolve into a utility in the future.

I have tested on RPi running Ubuntu 

```
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
Release:	20.04
Codename:	focal
```

It also worked on Big Sur, but on upgrading to Monterey it started failing, appears to be an OSX issue.
